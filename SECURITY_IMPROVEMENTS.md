# Security Improvements

This document outlines the security improvements implemented in the Teams Meeting Assistant Chrome Extension.

## 1. Secure API Key Storage

### Implementation
- Created `scripts/securityUtils.js` with encryption/decryption utilities
- Uses Web Crypto API with AES-GCM encryption
- Implements PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- Device-specific encryption using a unique device ID

### Changes Made
- API keys are now encrypted before storage in localStorage
- Modified `popup.js` to use `secureSetItem()` and `secureGetItem()` for API keys
- Updated `history.js` to retrieve API keys using secure storage
- Automatic migration of existing unencrypted keys to encrypted storage

### API Key Flow
1. User enters API key in settings
2. Key is validated and encrypted using device-specific key
3. Encrypted key is stored in localStorage with `_encrypted` suffix
4. Decrypted key is synced to `chrome.storage.local` for background script access
5. Background script retrieves decrypted key from `chrome.storage.local`

## 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Implementation
Added CSP to `manifest.json`:
```json
"content_security_policy": {
  "extension_pages": "script-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
}
```

### Security Benefits
- Prevents execution of inline scripts (except where necessary)
- Blocks loading of external scripts
- Prevents object/embed elements
- Allows inline styles (required for dynamic styling)

## 3. Input Sanitization

### Implementation
Added input validation and sanitization functions in `securityUtils.js`:
- `validateApiKey()`: Validates API key format
- `validateUrl()`: Ensures only HTTPS URLs are accepted for API endpoints
- `sanitizeInput()`: Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS
- `escapeHtml()`: Escapes HTML entities in displayed content

### Changes Made
- Added validation in `popup.js` for API keys and endpoints before saving
- Only HTTPS URLs are accepted for API endpoints
- API key format validation (OpenAI format or generic 20+ character format)

## 4. XSS Prevention

### Implementation
Fixed XSS vulnerability in `history.js`:
- Added `escapeHtml()` function to escape HTML entities
- Updated all `innerHTML` assignments to use escaped content
- Properly escaped team names, timestamps, and transcript content

### Protected Areas
- Team names in transcript lists
- Timestamp displays
- Transcript text content
- Screenshot analysis descriptions

## 5. Best Practices Implemented

### Secure Storage
- API keys are never stored in plain text
- Encryption keys are derived from device-specific identifiers
- Automatic cleanup of unencrypted legacy keys

### Data Validation
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- URL validation ensures HTTPS-only connections
- API key format validation prevents invalid keys

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security (encryption + validation + sanitization)
- CSP provides additional protection against script injection
- Secure communication between extension components

## 6. Migration Path

### Automatic Migration
- Existing unencrypted API keys are automatically migrated on first access
- Old unencrypted keys are removed after successful migration
- No user action required

### Backward Compatibility
- Extension continues to work with existing settings
- Seamless transition for users with saved API keys

## Usage Notes

### For Developers
- Always use `secureSetItem()` and `secureGetItem()` for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs before storage or use
- Use `escapeHtml()` when displaying user-generated content
- Ensure API endpoints use HTTPS

### For Users
- API keys are now securely encrypted
- Only HTTPS API endpoints are accepted
- Invalid API key formats will be rejected
- All stored data is protected with device-specific encryption
